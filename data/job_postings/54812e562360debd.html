<body><h2>Full Stack Software Engineer - Menlo Park, CA</h2>
<div><div>Aether believes the key to unlocking the potential of bioengineering and nanotechnology is the application of deep learning algorithms trained on massive biological datasets. To generate the data necessary to power deep learning algorithms, Aether will push the boundaries of hyper-throughput technologies. The robotic factory Aether Biomachines is building to revolutionize enzyme engineering will be orders of magnitude more efficient than anything that has been built before. Managing and tracking this biological data will require an unparalleled effort in software engineering.</div><div><br/>
</div><div>
As an early member of our software team, you will be setting the logical, infrastructural, and operational foundations upon which the laboratory will be run. You will be determining both the general product and architectural direction for operational software and IT products at Aether. This will initially include the Laboratory Information Management System, in particular the Data Pipelines, Quality Control, and Data Storage Services to process and store 10s of millions of data points being acquired on a monthly basis. Over time, the entire Operational Structure of the company will fall into the Operational Software Team responsibilities: Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Quality Management Systems, Product Lifecycle Management, Networking and IT, Electronic Laboratory Notebook, etc... You will be developing software from the ground-up with an early-stage team, and as such we are searching for someone who is excited by the autonomy, creative freedom, and rigor that this opportunity represents.
</div><div></div><br/>
<div>As a software engineer, you will be interfacing with scientists, roboticists, process engineers, management, and other functions across the organization to understand the key problems, propose solutions, implement, and iterate on them. In an environment where time is of the essence, you will bring a balanced perspective to prioritize results while ensuring the long term viability of the engineered systems being developed and implemented. You will be the primary decision maker for build vs buy decisions and, when appropriate, for the management of external teams of consultants or engineering partners.</div><div>
To set the appropriate foundations for the organization, you are comfortable and understand the product and timeline trade-offs between front-end, back-end, web-services, local tools, computing clusters, cloud deployment, etc… and make the appropriate case-by-case decision.</div><div><br/>
</div><div>
You will heavily influence software development practices within the organization and make sure they are appropriate to balance speed, safety, customer satisfaction, and are sustainable for the current size of a growing team.</div><div>
You will help grow a fast-paced, high-output band of engineers, hackers, and builders, and play a critical role in shaping the technical environment in which the engineering team will execute. You will work daily with industry and thought leaders in laboratory automation, chemical manufacturing, etc. Through hard work and dedication, you will power the creation of the most advanced factory supporting a revolution in chemical manufacturing.</div><div><br/>
