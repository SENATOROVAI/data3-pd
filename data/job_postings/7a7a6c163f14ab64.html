<body><h2>Director of Language Engineering - Seattle, WA 98104</h2>
<div><div>We believe that a great writing experience is fast, outcome-focused, and alive with your ideas. Going from start to finish on a document in three minutes. Knowing who will respond to anything you’ve written before you even press send. Writing software that puts your ideas at the center, with language that is certain to land the way you want.</div><div><br/>
</div><div>
We are looking for a thoughtful leader with a strong sense of stewardship to guide our work building the future of augmented writing. Our Language Understanding team is growing, and we need the right Director to build and lead this critical organization.</div><div><br/>
</div><div>
We are committed to creating a user experience that is first and foremost great for writing. This focus on making a great writing experience is a central guiding tenet at this key inflection point in our growth: how do we build with user empathy while scaling up our technology, our team, and the scope of the language problems we solve?
</div><div></div><br/>
<div>You’ll bring experience that helps you to recognize opportunities and obstacles that lie along the road ahead. You’ll make informed decisions today to create the best environment for the future. You’ll join a welcoming and collaborative natural-language processing group that works closely with broader engineering and product teams — where everyone is passionate about building the best language experiences in the world.</div><div><br/>
</div><div>
You have built products that real people can use. Your experience in research and in industry shows you that model hyperparameters and data cardinality can only get you so far: implementation details are only the support system for a strong, informed conception of a problem and a vision of a transformative solution. You have the technical depth to collaborate and advise a team on both the theoretical and runtime details of a production implementation, and an ethical foundation that sharpens your focus on the transformative impact of language on people’s social realities.</div></div><div><p><b>
