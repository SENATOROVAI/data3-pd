<body><h2>Data Scientist - San Francisco, CA</h2>
Corelight is an early-stage security startup based in downtown San Francisco and Columbus, OH. We secure some of the most sensitive and mission-critical networks in the world, and our rapidly-growing customer base includes eight of the Fortune 50. Based on the Zeek (formerly Bro) Network Security Monitor, a beloved and widely used open-source framework, Corelight Sensors transform high-volume network traffic into 'rocket fuel' for security analytics and operations. Following in the footsteps of successful open-source security companies such as Sourcefire and Tenable, Corelight's unfair market advantages include its founders: the inventor of Zeek and its key open-source committers. Join Corelight, and help us make the world's networks safer.

--------------------
Role and Opportunity
--------------------

We are building a world class and uniquely targeted team to drive research through data science. Key team members will use their strong data science skills, coupled with an enthusiasm to learn about a wide range of data-intensive analysis problems in the network security domain, to drive novel, durable, and effective threat identification. You will furthermore work with colleagues to define and build the data science technology stack needed both to grow the team and to enable new data-driven insights in a domain with unique opportunities and challenges. Finally, because Corelight can define the data our sensors generate, you will have a role in shaping how we extend the data itself to enable new types of analysis as needed. You will be able to look back a year from now and say two things with pride: first, "I helped build that from the ground up", and second, "we are generating insight that no one else in the world has achieved."

------------

Opportunity:
------------


<li>Work with Vern Paxson (creator of Zeek, UC Berkeley Professor and world renowned network security researcher) and with mentorship from Richard Bejtlich (famed threat defense thought leader)</li><li>Develop algorithms to identify activity buried within torrents of highly structured data</li><li>Identify apt opportunities to apply supervised and unsupervised techniques to robustly identify a wealth of behaviors, in the face of a range of real-world constraints</li><li>Specify improvements to the data itself (new / different parsers, data augmentation, etc.) that will enable unique insights and superior threat detection</li><li>Drive advances in the analytics tools and frameworks (across structured detection algorithms, machine learning, NLP, behavioral analysis, etc.) both for our growing threat research team and for the Corelight Sensor to create and execute your models</li><li>Author key materials to share (a) detection insights with the security community, and (b) guide analysts in employing the models you develop</li>
---------------

Qualifications:
---------------


<li>MS with 5+ years experience or PhD in computer science, or similar computational discipline, e.g. statistics, mathematics, physics (or equivalent experience)</li><li>Analysis: Strong data science skills, including a proven track record applying the techniques to real-world Big Data problems. Extensive experience with tools and environments such as R, Pandas, Matlab/Octave, Tensorflow, Spark</li><li>Knowledge of practical networking, security, and their intersection is highly beneficial - but can be offset by enthusiasm to learn about these domains from highly experienced experts</li>

A note on experience
--------------------

We understand that no candidate is perfectly qualified for any job. Experience comes in different forms; many skills are transferable; and passion goes a long way. Even more important than your resume is clear demonstration of skill, dedication, and the ability to thrive in a fluid and collaborative environment. We want you to learn new things in this role, and we encourage you to apply if your experience is close to what we're looking for.

Diversity of background and thought makes for better problem solving and more creative thinking, which is why we're dedicated to adding new perspectives to the team.

--------------------
Working at Corelight
--------------------

In addition to helping to make networks safer around the world, Corelight is a great place to work. We provide competitive salaries, equity and benefits, but those are just table stakes. No matter where you're based, we aspire to make working here one the best experiences of your career.</body>
