<p>
Twitter is your window into What's Happening in the world, live! As rich content continues to drive conversation, connection, and engagement on Twitter, product teams are focussed on surfacing a broad selection of compelling content to the user based on their interests.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
Our team, Cortex, is building technologies that enable product teams to create that experience. We are a team of ML engineers and researchers, trying to push boundaries of ML and personalization at Twitter. We work closely with ML product teams across the company (timelines, ads, recommendations, safety etc) to define, design and develop the core components that would enable them to deliver the desired experience to Twitter users.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>
Example projects include:</b></p>
<ul><li>Approximate Nearest Neighbor algorithms and related infrastructure at Twitter scale</li><li>Embeddings models and algorithms</li><li>Embedding infrastructure that allows teams to easily train, consume and share embeddings</li></ul><br/>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What You'll Do:</b></p>
<p>
Apply your research and engineering skills to either improve existing solutions, unlock new directions or provide entirely new ML solutions within Twitter. You will work closely with live production systems and product teams, and learn to deliver ML solutions at scale within the Twitter tech stack, whilst encouraging best practices for ML across the company.</p><br/>
<p></p>
