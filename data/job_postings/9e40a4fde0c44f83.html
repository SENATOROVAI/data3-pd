What are we Looking for?</b><br/>
Mobility in Indian cities is transforming, impacting the way people move and make their travel choices. While transit agencies are investing to establish intelligent systems to provide world-class services to the citizens, new technology-based mobility services are emerging to cater to individual demand-based trips. Usage of technology to provide transport services has increased the pace, the quality and the quantity of data collected on mobility patterns in our cities. This expanse of data can underpin transport planning decisions in cities. The key challenge, however, is to aggregate, integrate, analyze and share this data to inform better planning.</p><p>
WRI India’s Bus Karo Program is designed to engage with the State transport Undertakings (STUs) and other stakeholders to deliberate technical issues to enhance the development of bus systems, build capacity and foster peer to peer learning. Main streaming data-oriented decision making is one of the main approaches.</p><p>
