<body><h2>Data Scientist, Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (RegLab), Stanford Law School - Stanford, CA</h2>
<div>The Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (RegLab) at Stanford University is looking for a full-time Data Scientist to provide analytical expertise across our research programs.</div><div><br/>
</div><div><b>About RegLab:</b> Stanford’s RegLab partners with government agencies to design and evaluate programs, policies, and technologies that modernize governance. Government agencies are responsible for addressing some of society’s greatest challenges. Yet they increasingly lack the tools to design and evaluate initiatives based on rapid advances in the data sciences and the social sciences. RegLab (interim website: reglab.stanford.edu) is building a bridge between government agencies and academic frontiers in data science to revitalize the administrative state. We are an interdisciplinary team of legal experts, data scientists, social scientists, and engineers who are passionate about building an evidence base and high impact demonstration projects for better government. Our home at Stanford allows us to leverage state-of-the-art advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science that have the potential to dramatically improve and reenvision government.<br/>
