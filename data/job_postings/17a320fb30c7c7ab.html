<body><h2>Machine Learning Postdoctoral Fellow - San Francisco Bay Area, CA</h2>
<div>Berkeley Lab has an opening for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work in an emerging new area on novel machine learning and control techniques being applied to computer infrastructure (e.g. networking, compute, etc). This work will lead to the development of automation and optimization techniques for systems to become self-aware and intelligent. The goal of these networks is to effectively support complex distributed science big data needs, across complex multi-domain infrastructure such as Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. Developments of these techniques will lead to immense impact in the next generation of scientific discoveries requiring massive amounts of data movement from a variety of sources and emerging new trends with exascale computing.</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
Leveraging techniques from deep learning, pattern recognition and even artificial intelligence as a whole, this position will explore developing novel techniques deep reinforcement learning, working with large distributed data sets and quick processing of the model results. The successful candidate will work as part of unique and engaging team developing techniques linking two major research themes namely distributed deep reinforcement learning methods and real-world translation to DOE applications. This work will lead to impactful results advancing state-of-the-art network research by building novel deep reinforcement learning.</div><br/>
