<p>A research opportunity is currently available at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Public Health Strategy and Analysis (OPHSA) in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p>
<p>FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through regulation of a wide range of products including medical products, food and tobacco. OPHSA is located in the Office of Policy, Legislation, and International Affairs, in the Office of the Commissioner. OPHSA serves as a resource to the Agency for quantitative and qualitative research and analysis on emerging issues and for advancing work on priority public health initiatives. OPHSA does this through its work on initiatives such as opioids, drug pricing, and transparency, as well as by developing and executing research to link agency activities and outputs to public health outcomes.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of a mentor, potential training projects for OPHSA ORISE fellows include:</p>
<p> 1) Contribute to the development of visual analytical dashboards in Python, Qlik Sense, or Tableau; 2) data analysis of complex, large relational datasets in Python or other analytical tools. As part of these projects, the participant will be involved in scripting ad-hoc and novel solutions in Python.</p>
<p>In addition and under the guidance of a mentor, Fellows will have the opportunity to participate in the following:</p>
<ul><li>Analytical visualizations of data from National Poison Control Centers</li></ul><p>FDA uses consolidated data from all poison control centers in the US to better understand the potential harm experienced by millions of Americans following exposure to drugs, dietary supplements, or other substances regulated by the Agency. The participant will have opportunities to increase their understanding of the process to undertake improvement of an existing visual analytical platform, with real-time data updates, for Agency-wide use.</p>
<p> 2. Analysis and visualization of FDA approved first generic drugs and their impact on competition and pricing</p>
<p>Participants will collaborate with established FDA personnel in data analysis (and visual analytics) for a multi-phase study that seeks to determine the characteristics and marketing status of all first generics approved by FDA since 2010, as well as their impact on generic drug competition and pricing.</p>
<p>This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. The initial appointment is for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of FDA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time at FDA in the Silver Spring, Maryland, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.</p>
<p>Completion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA. OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.</p>
