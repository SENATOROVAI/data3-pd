You will help us achieve the ambitious goals we have set up for ourselves. We focus on collaboration first. This means on a daily basis you will be part of the design, coding, and reviews for both lower level and architectural level. Pull requests start with the developer either bootstrapping their own vision or pair/mob programming to bootstrap on a high level overview with pieces working together. Automated tests are a must. You will be able to learn data science in the process if you're interested in pursuing that path.</p></body>
