<div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>About Peritus</b></h2>
<div><div><div><div><p>Peritus enables self-healing autonomous datacenters with automated, cognitive support for infrastructure software and hardware. It is a funded startup co-created at The Hive in Palo Alto, CA that delivers artificial intelligence-based virtual support expert systems for data center service fulfillment and incident resolution.</p>
<p>
As datacenter vendors move from on-premise to the cloud their existing support system lacks the agility and cost-effectiveness for the cloud. Peritus significantly enhances operational efficiencies of existing support services and enables managed service providers &amp; system vendors to offer new business continuity entitlements. Peritus assists &amp; automates a wide spectrum of decisions in system support including incident classification, routing, contract coverage, incident resolution recipes and orchestration of incident management between subject matter experts (SMEs).</p>
<p>
Peritus’ unique vectorization of system log data drives predictive modeling with highly granular feature extraction for early detection of system events. The platform’s advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities drive Peritus’ incident modeling and predictive capabilities. The core service fulfillment engine uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods to predict incident features from system log data. Peritus delivers automated orchestration of incident resolution through its close integration with existing incident management platforms.</p>
