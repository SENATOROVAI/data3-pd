Understanding natural language is at the core of Google's technologies. The Natural Language Understanding (NLU) team at Google guides, builds, and innovates methodologies around semantic analysis and representation, syntactic parsing and realization, morphology and lexicon development. Our work directly impacts the Assistant, Search, the Knowledge Graph, and Google Translate, as well as other Machine Intelligence research.
</p><p>As a Computational Linguist, you will collaborate with Engineers and Researchers in Assistant and Research &amp; Machine Intelligence to develop language understanding models that improve our ability to understand and generate natural language. Many linguists focus on one or more languages in which they have special expertise, and propose directions and solutions to language-specific problems.</p><p>
Google aims to build products that organize the world's information and make it universally accessible to our users. As a Product Manager at Google, you could be working on new technologies, platforms, consumer facing products, and/or enterprise systems. The end goal will be to match you with the team that best aligns with your interests, experience, and where you will have the most impact.</p></div><div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>
