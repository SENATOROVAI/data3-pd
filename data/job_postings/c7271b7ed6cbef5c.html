<div><div>Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities â€” we're just getting started.
</div></div><div>The mission of the Facebook Video team is to create shared experiences and a sense of belonging through video. Video is a rich and immersive format and Facebook is at the forefront of social video experiences with products such as Live and Watch Parties so we have seen an explosive growth of both video production and consumption over the last few years. Surfacing and showing the most relevant videos at this scale while maintaining a healthy ecosystem that is free of content that is harmful is essential to creating a great user experience. The Video Integrity team is responsible for identifying the types of harms that exist and applying techniques ranging from manual labeling to state of the art ML to identify and detect and remove potential harm to our users, publishers and overall ecosystem. We are looking for strong Data Scientists who will be responsible for ensuring that we are developing a safe and healthy video ecosystem. This is a critical role that will be responsible for the measurement, detection and reduction of negative user experiences ranging from violence and adult content to evolving areas like misinformation and deep fakes. This role works closely with both product and engineering teams in identifying and executing on opportunities to improve the integrity of various video experiences. Successful candidates for this role will have a strong technical background as well as significant experience in big data, data science techniques and algorithms, product analytics and influencing decision making across different teams through data.
