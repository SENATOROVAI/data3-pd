<p>About The I School</p>
<p>UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.</p>
<p>The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.</p>
<p>We offer professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our on-campus master’s program (MIMS) trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our web-based master’s program (MIDS) is the first and only degree available completely online to train data science professionals. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to contribute to knowledge and to the policies that influence the organization, use, and sharing of information.</p>
