<body><h2>Biomedical Data Standards Specialist-Data Collection - South San Francisco, CA 94083</h2>
The Position

Data has the power to answer more than one question and enable multiple discoveries, but only if Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Making the FAIR way the easy way to manage data requires having the right processes and infrastructure in place from data planning to data release. Adherence to global data standards and terminologies is critical, not only to ensure that data are FAIR but also to ensure data will meet global regulatory expectations (e.g., for FDA submission). The Biomedical Data Standards Specialist supports this effort by driving the design, implementation and governance of biomedical data standards from protocol development to regulatory submission and beyond, by being a technical, process and business expert on industry-wide biomedical data standards. They maintain content in a metadata repository to ensure it continuously reflects the latest approved biomedical data standards. The present position focuses on eCRF data collection standards including controlled terminology.

Responsibilities and Accountabilities
Develop long term strategy for the design, implementation, governance and use of biomedical data standards in line with Roche Pharma objectives.
Lead and contribute to the design, and governance of biomedical (including clinical trial) data standards from protocol to submission including the identification of the needs of key stakeholders for all studies in PD, pRED, and gRED.
Lead and contribute to the implementation into tools (e.g. RAVE, SAS and R) of the biomedical (including clinical trial) data standards from protocol to submission for use by molecule and study teams.
Guide the strategy for the prioritization of the development of new biomedical data standards.
Lead and contribute to specialist teams within the Pharma Data Governance framework or other future governance models
Extensive expert knowledge and understanding of biomedical data standards and the programming tools (e.g. RAVE, SAS, R) available for their implementation. Ensures the biomedical data standards continue to meet the needs of Roche Pharma.
Lead and contribute to the GDS Request process with the goal of continually growing the biomedical data standards. Evaluate requests for topics including, but not limited to impact analysis, risk assessment, cost/benefit analysis, proposal of alternatives.
Provide specialist advice and support the implementation of biomedical data standards to all of Biometrics (Biostats, SPA, CDM and PCOR) on molecules across PD, pRED and gRED and the transformation of previously collected data to the appropriate data models supporting data curation across PD, pRED and gRED.
Contribute to the maintanence of content in the Global Data Standards Repository (GDSR), or future tools, to ensure that it reflects the lastest approved biomedical data standards
Provide input to MDIS Information Architects in the design of biomedical data models and implementation data models.
Collaborate with Data Standards representatives from other companies and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) to ensure proactive adoption of new industry standards and to provide Roche input into their development.
Represent Roche externally to SDOs and other organizations involved in the implementation of data standards.
Drive a culture based on FAIR data principles and good data stewardship across Biometrics and beyond
Continuous improvement: Reviews the process, deliverables and feedback to identify potential areas requiring adjustment or review and ensures quality deliverables.
Ensures appropriate project planning and maintains good record keeping of activities. Generates metrics regarding the performance of processes (including key performance indicators or KPIs) and the usage and value of biomedical data standards.
Develops and maintains a network of key individuals (internal and external) who support the communication and evolution of data standards. Uses a variety of communication channels to raise awareness (PDConnect, “how to” documents, presentations etc.)
