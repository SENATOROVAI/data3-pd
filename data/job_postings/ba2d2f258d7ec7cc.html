<p><b>Job Description</b></p>
<p>We're a team of visual analytics and human-computer interaction researchers who love making big, complex data useful through new computational methods, great visual design, compelling interaction, support for sound analytic techniques, innovative cognitive modeling, novel human-machine teaming, and solid engineering. We develop new ways for people to benefit from data and care deeply about the intersection between human and computer to solve problems in new ways. We work with partners across PNNL to create solutions for our customers' hardest analysis challenges.</p>
<p>This position is for an early career researcher who is passionate about innovating at the intersection of visualization, HCI, and machine learning. The researcher will contribute to and lead small teams that develop innovative visual analytics prototypes that address challenges across a wide set of national security application domains. The researcher is expected to interact with the international visualization community, publishing in and attending conferences including but not limited to IEEE VIS, ACM CHI, ACM IUI. The position carries the expectation of creating new business in visualization or human-computer interaction research (for instance, through proposal writing) and publishing scientific results in peer-reviewed literature.</p>
<ul><li><p>Researchers and practitioners work side by side to apply advanced theories, methods, algorithms, models, evaluation tools and testbeds, and computational-based solutions address complex scientific challenges affecting energy, biological sciences, the environment, and national security.</p></li><li><p>
Operating on the data-information-knowledge continuum, staff at PNNL employ diverse methods to confront significant problems of national interest—from distilling distributed data into knowledge that supports decision processes, to enabling resilient technologies that enhance computing at extreme scales, to equipping cyber defenders with tools that prevent damaging cyber-attacks.</p></li><li><p>
