Indigo improves grower profitability, environmental sustainability, and consumer health through the use of natural microbiology and digital technologies. Utilizing beneficial plant microbes and agronomic insights, Indigo works with growers to sustainably produce high quality harvests. The company then connects growers and buyers directly to bring these harvests to market. Working across the supply chain, Indigo is forwarding its mission of harnessing nature to help farmers sustainably feed the planet. The company is headquartered in Boston, MA, with additional offices in Memphis, TN, Research Triangle Park, NC, Sydney, Australia, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and São Paulo, Brazil. http://www.indigoag.com/ ( http://www.indigoag.com/%20%20 )

Responsibilities:

<li>Set up own development environment, gain a working knowledge of the main tools that the team uses (Gurobi, Looker, Snowflake, Confluence, Jira, Git, AWS, Docker), and do a guided tour (supplemented with self-guided exploration) of UDP to gain a basic understanding of the most important data tables</li><li>Understand the main business tradeoffs and identify reasonable opportunities for optimization in one of Indigo's business units (e.g., Marketplace offer-bid matching, trip building in Indigo Transport, FOS placement in Indigo Carbon)</li><li>Contribute to a mathematical or ML model that addresses a relevant business problem (e.g., an extension to our freight pricing model to include seasonality, or a model for optimizing the placement of agronomists); summarize the model contributions in a well-written report that clearly states the assumptions and results; present the results to team members and be receptive to feedback</li><li>Gain a thorough understanding of Indigo's main businesses, purpose, and values, as well as how OR can help achieve its mission/goals</li><li>Earn the trust of peers and project stakeholders by implementing a non-trivial optimization model or algorithm that addresses a relevant business problem and that results in actionable insights for a business unit</li><li>Develop an individual research agenda that is consistent with Indigo's mission and propose, with minor guidance, ambitious (but achievable) quarter goals</li>
Competencies:

<li>Deep understanding and knowledge of at least one OR core discipline (e.g., linear programming, combinatorial optimization, network flows, dynamic programming, stochastic models, machine learning) as well as good breadth and working knowledge of three or more</li><li>High competency in at least one statistical computing language (Python – strongly preferred, R, Julia) and one high-performance object-oriented language (Java, C++)</li><li>Working knowledge of SQL and popular data science libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, tidyverse, R Shiny, TensorFlow)</li><li>Some knowledge of full-stack web development, as well as the ability and desire to quickly acquire new software skills as needed</li><li>Ability to simplify and model the most relevant tradeoffs in a complex and loosely stated business problem, translating it into a tractable mathematical program</li><li>Strong communication skills. Ability to partner and earn the trust of a variety of stakeholders and audiences, including project managers, software engineers, business analysts, and executives to gather requirements and understand business context</li><li>Thrives in a fast-paced growth environment; comfortable with ambiguity, projects with uncertain outcomes, and shifting goals. Excellent prioritization skills and bias for action. Delivers business value early and often, while managing stakeholder expectations</li><li>Methodical in their thinking.

Uses collaboration tools (Git, Confluence, Jira) effectively for this purpose</li><li>Ability to think big and come up with solutions and implementations that work at scale</li>
Qualifications:

<li>PhD (preferred) in operations research, computer science, engineering, statistics or other related disciplines, or MS with 3+ years of working experience in these areas</li><li>5+ years of experience using mathematical modeling, optimization, machine learning, and simulation to solve complex resource allocation problems</li><li>Demonstrated experience solving NP-hard problems and developing effective algorithms and heuristics</li><li>3+ years of experience writing software in at least two of the following: Python, R, Java, and C++. Working knowledge of SQL and popular data science libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, matplotlib, tidyverse, R Shiny, TensorFlow, etc.). Some full-stack web development experience preferred</li><li>Experience solving large problems with at least one MILP solver package and/or modelling language (CPLEX, Gurobi, XPRESS, AMPL)</li>
