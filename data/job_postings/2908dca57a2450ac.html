About Earnin:
Our financial system is fundamentally unfair for people who live paycheck to paycheck. People shouldn't have to wait weeks to get the pay they've already earned. This wait forces them to spend more than $100 billion a year on short-term credit products, late fees and overdraft fees.

Earnin helps people overcome this unfairness by giving them real-time access to their money as soon as they have worked -- without fees or interest.

Our team is bound together by a desire to level the financial playing field. Our investors, Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners and March Capital believe we will change the world.

You can help make a difference. Join us.

About the Team:
Business decisions at Earnin rely heavily on good analysis. Autonomous, cross-functional product and operational teams (we call them "pods") drive these decisions on a day to day basis. You'll help a group of pods make product decisions by providing them with insights from our data. For success in this role, you'll need to be comfortable diving deep into the data, owning your analysis, and communicating your insights in an accessible way.

The Risk Pod sits at the heart of Earnin. As the owners of the core business metrics, Risk powers the financial engine that allows Earnin to constantly deliver value to our community. Our Risk team has taken a unique approach to risk management, portfolio management, and interacting with our community members.

We're in the process of building out our analytics capabilities, so you'll also have a chance to shape the methods and tools that we use.
