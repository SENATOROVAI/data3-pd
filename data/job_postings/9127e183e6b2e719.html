<body><h2>Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) (55-8009) - San Diego, CA</h2>
<div>Overview
</div><div><div><div><div>This Statement of Work covers the need for the student services to provide technical and analytical support in the fields of computer science, computer engineering, information systems, electrical engineering, physics or a similar area of study in order to provide support to the Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) project. The purpose of the project is to assist the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific (NIWC PAC) personnel in development of software that will route traffic between the unmanned aerial vehicle and the Automated Digital Networking System (ADNS).</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
Unmanned Carrier Aviation is the MQ-25A aircraft that the Advanced Networking Tactical System (ANTS) will be housed in. The OSS (Operational Support System) is the software that is on the ANTS. ANTS is an Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) Airborne System that is compatible with the NAVYâ€™s ADNS INC III Ship and Shore infrastructure. ANTS is composed of the following major components: Plaintext (PT) enclave, Inline Network Encryptor (INE), Ciphertext (CT) enclave, and the OSS. The OSS provides the common access point for the aircraft interface, maintainers, and system administrators for the configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting, and control of the ANTS Airborne System. The OSS is composed of the following core capabilities: system administration, monitoring, alerts, messaging, built-in-test (BIT), and autonomous troubleshooting.
