<div><div>Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together.

Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities â€” we're just getting started.

This role will focus on signals, detection and recommendations integrity. Identifying potentially problematic content is a challenging problem spanning many products and platforms. A Data Scientist in this role will partner closely with our AI/ML and Infra teams to establish a cohesive strategy for evaluating the performance of the space and identifying opportunities for us to improve. This space is very broad and will take time to lock-down.
