<p><b>What the EPA project is about</b></p>
<p>The Environmental Public Health Division (EPHD) within the Office of Research and Development (ORD) at EPA focuses on the adverse public health impacts of environmental exposures. The research utilizes human subjects data and publicly available databases to investigate the human health effects of air and water pollutants and other environmental exposures. Researchers in the Epidemiology Branch of EPHD have created an Environmental Quality Index (EQI) for all counties across the U.S. for the time period 2000-2005. Five environmental domains were created: air, water, land, sociodemographic and built. The researchers are currently updating the index for 2006-2010 and also exploring different spatial aggregations (e.g., census tract, neighborhood). The researchers have used the EQI as an exposure metric in health outcome research utilizing health databases with millions of records.</p>
