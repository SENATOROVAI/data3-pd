<body><h2>Physics Data Scientist - Foothill Ranch, CA</h2>
<p>TAE Technologies, Inc, formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy, has a national lab sized research program in high beta magnetically confined fusion plasmas, based around the advanced, beam driven, Field Reversed Configuration. It has built and is operating the new C-2W experiment, aka Norman, which is one of the largest fusion plasma experiments in the United States. The goals of C-2W are to push high beta fusion plasmas into new parameter regimes and to guide the design of future fusion power plants. With its vast diagnostic suite, C-2W is an ideal and fertile testing ground for new plasma theory and simulation.The Data Science organization at TAE is looking for a talented individual to help us tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges.</p>
