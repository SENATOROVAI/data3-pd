“We make magic.” That’s our motto at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. And it permeates everything we do. At Disney, you’ll help inspire that magic by enabling our teams to push the limits of entertainment and create the never-before-seen!<br/>
<br/>
The Lead Machine Learning Platform Engineer spearheads development and operationalization of key framework components required in the end-to-end machine leaning lifecycle. Using these building blocks, Parks Data and Machine Learning Platform (“the platform”) supports a wide variety of applications in computer vision, natural language processing, data analytics, predictions, recommendations, content creation and optimization. The platform enables multiple studios of developers, data engineers, data scientists, content creators and business analysts across the entire Disney Parks Experiences and Products (DPEP) organization to build, deploy, sustain and continuously improve AI services.<br/>
