<body><h2>Senior Data Scientist - Mountain View, CA 94035</h2>
<div><div>About Us</div><div><br/>
</div><div>
We like working at Verdigris because we enjoy spending our time on meaningful problems. At Verdigris, weâ€™re observing that it is not just software, but rather AI that is eating the world. In the near future automation will do the heavy lifting for us in a way that will transform the way we transport goods, grow food, manufacture products, and ultimately change the way our homes and buildings operate. Our mission is to sustain and enrich human life through the development of responsive energy intelligence for buildings.</div><div><br/>
</div><div>
We built the first AI-driven smart IoT electricity monitor. The unique capabilities of our hardware and algorithms allow us to provide global electricity monitoring for prominent brands in the Fortune 500 including ARM, Jabil, ABB, and Panasonic. The systems also capture a richer set of data than legacy meters. This allows our smart electricity monitoring system to generate powerful insights, predict failure of critical equipment, track energy demand, and inform efficiency projects. In order to achieve these extraordinary outcomes we require an exceptional team.</div><div><br/>
