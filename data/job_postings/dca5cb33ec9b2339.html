<body><h2>Data Scientist - United States</h2>
<h3 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Data Scientist</b></h3><h4 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>
US</b></h4><p>
Nehemiah Security is in search of Mid to Senior level Data Scientist. The data scientist will be responsible for creating models that pertain to our customers’ vulnerability to cyber attack given technical details of how the customer’s technology infrastructure is set up; and models that pertain to how a customer’s business is financially exposed to an attacker exploiting those vulnerabilities. The Data Scientist will report to the Global Chief Technology Officer.<br/>
</p><p>In order to make the models relevant to a specific customer, the successful candidate will have to work with data that considers the current cyber threat environment globally, the customer’s exposure to those threats (in terms of their technology infrastructure’s configuration) and the financial losses that those threats could cause. Since the models are of a range of possible attacks, considering the personality and motivation of the attacker, as well as the possible responses from the company, the models must produce a range of outputs at different probabilities.</p><br/>
