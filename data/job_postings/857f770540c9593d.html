<body><h2>Director of Data Engineering - Palo Alto, CA</h2>
For over one hundred years, cities have managed their streets with concrete, paint, signage, and signals. The last ten years have seen a dramatic degradation of cities' ability to manage the movement of vehicles in the public realm. The tools currently available to them to fight back are limited, largely proprietary, and have done a poor job of solving for real issues.

Lacuna is working directly with cities to establish a new, digital environment that will allow them to effectively manage the public right-of-way for the next 100 years. This will result in a digital infrastructure that will fully support 21st century mobility—everything from scooters to self-driving cars to flying taxis. We aspire to be uniquely city- and public-friendly—we want to build this future on a foundation of open source and open standards, with privacy- and society-first principles from the start.

We are housed at Playground Global, an incubator with fantastic facilities, near the California Avenue train station in Palo Alto, CA.
