<body><h2>Engineer I (Plant Optimization) - United States</h2>
<div><div>At Packaging Corporation of America (PCA), we think of ourselves as more than a box manufacturer. We are an ideas and solutions company. We seek to be the leader in helping our customers — large and small — package, transport and display products of all kinds. It just happens to be that corrugated products are our area of expertise.
<br/>
At PCA, you’ll find the best people in the industry operating in a “golden rule” culture. We actively promote mutually rewarding relationships with each other and our customers by advocating respect for every individual, ethical and fair practices, and the highest standards in what we say and do.

</div><div></div><div><b>Position Summary:</b><b><br/>
</b></div><div></div><div>This position reports directly to the regional Area Operations Manager and will provide engineering support to all plant functions to include operations, maintenance, and other corrugated plant functional areas. This position is a developmental position that provides support to optimize plant equipment, improve reliability, enhance and sustain product quality while maximizing throughput and product revenue. This position will result in an overall understanding of plant operations and management skills needed for career development and promotional opportunities to various positions within the PCA corrugated plant operations group or other PCA supporting groups.<br/>

<b>Dimensions:</b><br/>
</div><div>
</div><div>
Currently there are nine Area Operations Managers with responsibilities for improving operations and maximizing capabilities within their region. Existing plants have minimal staffing, lack in technical bench strength, and have limited resources to coordinate and manage multiple improvement initiatives. This initiative is a pilot initiative to embed engineers in the larger plants within the region and utilize those engineers at other plants within that region as needed. Several of the initiatives are already identified targeting improvements in reliability and operational efficiency. This optimization process or “push” will result in additional workload requiring more resources to achieve multiple objectives within the time frame necessary while maintaining and sustaining current operational gains. These additional resources also provide benefits for personnel development and succession planning related to workforce demographics and attrition rates. Once the regional program is established additional resources can be added.<br/>
