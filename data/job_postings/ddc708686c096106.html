About Our Team</b></h2>
<div>
<div></div><div><p>The Radiation and Nuclear Detection Systems department undertakes research and development of ionizing radiation and rare signature detection systems to address broad nuclear security needs in support of various US Government programs. Through internal and external collaborations our department targets applications in nuclear proliferation detection, nuclear non-proliferation, international safeguards, arms control treaty verification, radiological emergency response, and other national security objectives such as explosives detection. We specialize in designing detection systems for the anticipated radiation signature and background for specific applications starting at Technology Readiness Level 1 (basic research) all the way up to 5 (field experiments). Areas of significant experience and expertise include: fission-energy neutron detection and imaging, gamma spectroscopy, anti-neutrino and muon detection, weak source detection techniques, and high-channel-count systems. Radiation transport modeling and simulation is used extensively to understand and verify experimental results and optimize detector design. Data analysis and algorithm development for particle identification and discrimination is conducted.</p>

Security Clearance</b></h2>
<div>
<div></div><div><p>This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance.</p><p>
Sandia will conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.</p><p>
If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.</p><p>
Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia and will require uncleared access for greater than 179 during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.</p>
