<body><h2>Product Manager, OODAPay - San Francisco, CA</h2>
<div><div><b>About OODA Health</b></div><div>
Founded in 2017 by a team of experienced digital health and technology executives, OODA Health is transforming the administration of healthcare. Today, the US healthcare system wastes $400 billion every year on an outdated and broken claims adjudication process that creates friction and frustration for payers, providers and patients alike. Patients wrestle with surprise bills that arrive months after care is received and are impossible to understand. Providers suffer unexpected denials and delays for reimbursement, and chase patients for payment rather than focus on delivering care. Payers are locked in zero sum negotiations with providers, unable to advance care management goals.</div><div>
</div><div>
OODA Health is transforming the administrative experience in healthcare by enabling collaborative, real-time interactions between providers, members and payers. With the OODA Health solution, claims adjudication will be instantaneous, and providers will be paid upon patient checkout. Payers will assume responsibility for patient collections, guaranteeing immediate payment to the provider and relieving physicians from chasing patients for money. Care management strategies will be based on real-time patient risk models, rather than retrospective claim reviews. Critical interactions will occur at the point of care, rather than months after an encounter.</div><div>
</div><div>
We are a passionate, growing team looking for dedicated teammates to make a major impact on the healthcare system. We are committed to living our company values to provide a positive and dynamic working environment for our team members. Based on the principle of Colonel John Boydâ€™s OODA Loop, we know we must move quickly and with purpose to effect meaningful change in healthcare.</div><div><br/>
