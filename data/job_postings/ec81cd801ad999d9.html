<body><h2>Lockheed Martin Space Professional Opportunities - University of Arizona - Palo Alto, CA 94304</h2>
Are you passionate about state-of-the-art technology in space exploration? Do you like seeing your work applied to real life applications that travel to space? Then you should join Lockheed Martin Space’s Advanced Technology Center (ATC).<br/>
<br/>
The ATC is the research lab for LM Space. Through our own skills and those of our partners—including universities and research labs around the world—we’re able to put vision in motion. While we are a part of LM's space division, our technologies are far-reaching across domains. Napkin sketches of lasers that can shoot down UAVs—we made it real. Changing molecules so metals behave differently? We invented that. ATC’s story is written in the success of missions here on Earth and far, far into space. Our innovation extends beyond incremental change. We strive for first-of-a-kind capability with enduring impact. Whatever the application, our charter is to create game-changing technologies. At the ATC, we’re inspiring change in our endless pursuit of what’s next.<br/>
<br/>
Our employees perform scientific experiments, investigations, observations and related research studies into the nature and operation of natural phenomena in a variety of fields, using the scientific methods. They develop theories for understanding, characterizing and organizing natural phenomena into a systematic and meaningful pattern for the benefit of project advancement and emerging technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Our facilities are located in Sunnyvale & Palo Alto, CA and Littleton, CO.<br/>
<br/>
ATC primarily hires Research Engineers and Research Scientists, often with backgrounds in optical sciences, systems engineering, materials science, data science, autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, hypersonics, and many other related fields.<br/>
