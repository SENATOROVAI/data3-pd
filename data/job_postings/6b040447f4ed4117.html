Data is at the core of Outreach's strategy. It drives our customers and ourselves to the highest levels of success. We use it for everything from customer health scores and revenue dashboards, to operational metrics of our AWS infrastructure, to helping increase product engagement and user productivity through automated natural language understanding, to predictive analytics and causal inference via experimentation. As our customer base continues to grow, we are looking towards new ways of leveraging our data to save our customers time and improve their sales efficiency.</div><div>

Key goal of the Data Science team is to transform how sales reps operate by enabling personalized guided selling. This requires a deep understanding of customer communication - emails threads and call/meetings transcripts, to extract useful information, determine the situation the deal is in and recommend next steps.

You will be responsible for delivering models, data-driven functionality, and end-user features based on these models that will be deployed into production, as well as analyzing the data to produce actionable insights and inform next steps. You will help grow the NLP team, own the outcomes of projects and initiatives, mentor and enable team members to be successful, collaborate with other teams including Data Science, Engineering, Product and Marketing.</div></div>
