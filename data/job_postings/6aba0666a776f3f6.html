<body><h2>Senior Data Scientist - Pasadena, CA</h2>
<p>The Senior Data Scientist is an upper-level position in 605’s data science group, and is focused on the statistics-heavy, technical/backend aspects of data analytics. At 605, the Data Science and Client Analytics teams share a baseline knowledge of statistics and machine learning, R and python, and familiarity with relational databases and the scale/variety of 605’s data assets. In contrast to the Client Analytics team, Data Scientists bring to the table some deeper technical skills, including:</p><ul>
<li>Hands-on experience with industry-standard predictive modeling solutions such as scikit-learn, xgboost, Spark ML, and H2O.ai in a production setting</li><li>Familiarity with diverse methods for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, ETL pipelines in general</li><li>A more nuanced understanding of cloud-based (Amazon Web Services) computing resources/infrastructure, especially the need for and methods of parallelization for analytics tasks</li><li>Experience in designing and implementing wrapper/tool/utility functions for automated tasks, to be used by less-technical Analytics team members, and organizing them into distributable, regularly maintained and tested R/python packages</li><li>Proficiency with source code management (git) and related code development/review workflows, as well as continuous integration tools like Travis and/or Jenkins</li></ul><p>Data Scientists at 605 are generally involved in at least two different projects at any given time and work alongside other data scientists or analysts. Projects produce both client-facing deliverables as well as internal tools/datasets consumed by other various teams at 605.
