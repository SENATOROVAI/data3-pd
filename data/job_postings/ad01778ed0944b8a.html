Departmental Overview

The Graduate Division oversees every stage of graduate student life: applications, admissions, fellowships and grants, tracking academic progress and degree milestones, academic employment and preparation for teaching, mentoring activities and professional development. Our mission is to sustain the world-renowned excellence of more than 100 master's and doctoral programs, and to assist our almost 11,000 graduate students on academic, financial, personal and professional matters throughout their studies. The Division implements policies developed by the Graduate Council of the Academic Senate to ensure the quality of Berkeley's graduate education. We work to distribute resources equitably to graduate students across the disciplines in our 17 schools and colleges.

Berkeley graduates more doctoral recipients annually — including from populations underrepresented in higher education — than does any other research university and our numerous cutting-edge master's programs attract students from all over the world. The diverse backgrounds and passions of our faculty and students support the excellence that makes Berkeley second to none in its breadth, depth, and reach of scholarship, research, and public service — in its impact on California and the U.S., as well as around the globe.
