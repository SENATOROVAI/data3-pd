<body><h2>ALS Beamline Scientist - San Francisco Bay Area, CA</h2>
<div><b>Discover your future at Berkeley Lab!</b></div><br/>
<div>
Berkeley Lab’s, Photon Science Group of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Division Advanced Light Source (ALS) is seeking one or two Scientists with interests and experience in soft x-ray spectroscopy, scattering, or microscopy applied to a wide variety of systems. The successful applicants will work in user support and outreach, technique development, and collaborate with internal and external scientists. The position will report to either the Dichroism Program Lead or the Scattering Program Lead within ALS Photon Science Operations.</div><br/>
<div>
The positions will contribute to the division’s quantum and functional materials scientific areas by providing scientific, technical expertise and leadership in the application of soft x-ray spectroscopy, scattering, or spectromicroscopy techniques. The scientists’ responsibilities include developing and using state-of-the-art x-ray equipment at a leading synchrotron radiation facility, participating in the development of data acquisition and analysis methods, supporting users conducting experiments at the ALS, and further developing the scientific program of their beamline through their own research, their outreach to the synchrotron user community and their participation in research collaborations at LBNL.</div><br/>
<div>
This multidisciplinary position requires highly developed analytical and quantitative skills, initiative, and independence, in order to critically impact the achievement of ALS organizational goals.</div><br/>
<div>
The ALS is a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science national scientific user facility whose excellent scientific reputation, expert staff, and capabilities in the soft x-ray, hard x-ray, and infrared regimes attract more than 2,000 academic and industrial users each year in disciplines spanning physical, chemical, materials, biological, energy, and Earth sciences. It is one of five Berkeley Lab user facilities that serve a combined 11,000 users annually. The co-location of these user facilities – including the Molecular Foundry Nanoscale Science Research Center and the NERSC scientific computing center, as well as Berkeley Lab's outstanding programs in materials and chemical sciences among others – offers a prime environment for collaborative science. The ALS has been a global leader in soft x-ray science for more than two decades and is currently undertaking a new project (ALS-U) that will endow the facility with state-of-the-art x-ray capabilities. It's an exciting time to join our growing team!</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
The core values of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) reflect a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We seek candidates who will support a culture in which the entire ALS community feels welcomed and valued.
