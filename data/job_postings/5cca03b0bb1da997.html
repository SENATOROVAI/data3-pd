<body><h2>Research Engineer – Deep Learning and Generative Design - Palo Alto, CA</h2>
<p>The Core-AI-ML research group, within Research and Advanced Engineering, is spearheading the process of discovery through and democratization of AI-ML across all engineering functions within the Ford product landscape. In order to realize a Ford vision of leadership, the Core-AI-ML research team, is looking for highly qualified and motivated candidates who are ready to take on challenging cross-functional problems that require discovery through fundamental research in directions that have so far received limited attention from the AI-ML community at large.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the Core AI-ML team, you will be responsible for conducting research for advancing the state-of-the–art in the general areas of Deep Learning as they relate to generative design techniques. Techniques such as deep generative networks for data augmentation and trajectory synthesis of complex dynamical systems as well as for design synthesis through techniques such as topology/shape optimization and large design space exploration. This role requires the progression of the state-of-the-art of known techniques in generative design, adversarial networks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs) as well as the innovations in evolutionary algorithms, inverse problems, bio-mimicry, neural surrogates for physical systems with the objective of delivering novel but functional solutions. In addition, you will also interface with leading researchers in academia, be active in publication and IP generation, and represent Ford at leading conferences such as CVPR, NeurIPS, ICRA, ICLR etc.<br/>
