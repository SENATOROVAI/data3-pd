<body><h2>Researcher - Redmond, WA</h2>
<div>As a Researcher in Microsoftâ€™s Applied Sciences Group, you will build software for novel displays and user input devices, especially capacitive touch and pen digitizers. This work will range from entirely speculative new concepts, to programs intended to ship within one or two years, to brief short-term consulting on matters of urgent interest to our product team. You will apply both your theoretical knowledge and your practical skill in prototyping, testing, and demonstrating your ideas.</div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>
Responsibilities</b></h2><div>
You can:</div><ul><li>Invent algorithms that solve unusual, poorly-studied numerical problems, borrowing ideas from digital signal processing, digital communications, statistics, machine learning, or other math familiar to you</li><li>Quickly prototype and refine these algorithms, in an environment like MATLAB, R, or SciPy</li><li>Implement these algorithms and write other software in C or C++, in some cases for embedded platforms, with or without an operating system</li><li>Build and operate the specialized electronic and mechanical tools needed to gather training data, test software, and otherwise advance your work, yourself and in collaboration with others</li><li>Use git and other similar tools to manage complexity, and present your work to others in a way they can use and understand</li></ul><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>
Qualifications</b></h2><div>
A typical candidate for this job will hold advanced degrees in electrical engineering, computer science, or closely related fields, but this is not a requirement. Other helpful (but not mandatory) experience includes:</div><ul><li>Capacitive touch sensors, and other capacitive user interface devices</li><li>Verilog or VHDL for FPGAs, especially for video interfacing and processing</li><li>PC graphics programming, with an understanding of what drives latency through that pipeline</li><li>Various ARM architectures and instruction sets, especially for lower-end microcontrollers, and systems programming generally</li><li>Schematic capture, SPICE simulation, and layout for simple electronics, like a Cortex-M3 microcontroller on a board with some analog interface circuits, and sufficient technician skill to assemble and test your design</li></ul><div></div><br/>
