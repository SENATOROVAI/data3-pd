<p><b>Sr. Data Scientist</b><br/>
Sr. Data Scientist for Intelligrated Software, LLC in Alpharetta, GA<br/>
<br/>
<b>Responsibilities:</b><br/>
Develop decision support tools based on optimization research and advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the intelligent warehouse control capabilities in the Warehouse Execution System (WES) software platform. This includes material flow balance, optimal storage location assignment and retrieval policies, smart routing and sequencing, efficient inventory slotting. Own the strategic planning and research initiatives involved with the WES platform, including forecasting, optimization, and process improvement. Provide applied optimization techniques and formulate efficient and highly scalable solution methods. Perform algorithm design, mathematical modeling, documentation, coding, simulation, integration and systematic performance implemented in Python, R, or Java. Solve business problems pragmatically and translate business requirements into data-driven decision-making problems. Leverage NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas to fully harness and analyze data, clean, visualize, extract and/or engineer features. Perform descriptive analysis, statistical inference, experimental design using statistical packages including SAS, R, SQL server or MySQL. Implement Monte Carlo, and discrete-event simulation in Python or MATLAB. Employ advanced data mining and machine learning techniques to deploy predictive analytics including supervised and unsupervised learning, classification and clustering algorithms using regression, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM, PCA, K-means, KNN, and neural networks utilizing Seaborn, and SciKit-learn libraries. Conduct prescriptive analysis to optimize systems including linear, non-linear, and mixed integer programing, network optimization, queueing theory, time series, and recommender systems using MATLAB, CPLEX or Gurobi optimization software packages. Provide structured documents and analytical reports consumable by non-technical stakeholders. Effectively communicate complex concepts with customers and clients, senior management and colleagues from computer science, production, and business backgrounds. Participate in and/or drive collaborations with clients.</p><p><b>
