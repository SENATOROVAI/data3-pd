<body><h2>Data Scientist, Analytics - Machine Translation - Menlo Park, CA</h2>
<div><div>Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities â€” we're just getting started.
</div></div><div><br/>
We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our AI Data Science and Analytics team, focusing on Machine Translation. The Machine Translation team is working to break language barriers to create a world where everyone on Facebook can understand everyone else, no matter what languages they speak. In pursuit of this mission, the team has created machine translation systems that serve over 2 billion translations every day across 2000 different language pairs. However, this journey is still only 1% finished, and the team won't rest until they can produce human quality translations for all language directions. The ideal candidate will have a strong background as a data scientist working on machine translation systems, have strong technical and analytical skills, and have experience working with massive amounts of data.
