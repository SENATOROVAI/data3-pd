<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Nurse RN</b></h2>
<h5 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Cary, NC</b></h5>
<p></p><p><b><i>Vein Clinics of America</i></b></p><br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>POSITION:</b> RN Provider (Part-Time)</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>REPORTS TO:</b> Regional Manager - Operations</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION, BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:</b></p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>Just as the Physicians of VCA develop, perfect and focus their attention on the treatment of large vein disease through the utilization of image guided injections or endovenous laser treatment, RN Providers specialize in the treatment of medium and small vein disease utilizing visually guided sclerotherapy under the clinical supervision of the Physician. Working together, the Physician and the RN Provider are able to provide complete and highly efficacious treatment to patients presenting with a combination of large vein disease and medium/small vein disease.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>Specialization also affords RN Providers with the opportunity to work towards and build semi-independent practices with patients that present with just medium and small vein disease.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>The RN Providers are integral to both clinical and practice building operations. While RN Providers, as well as the physicians, are supported by a strong operational team at both the clinic and the Home Office that provide a multitude of services ranging from marketing to billing and collections to patient financial planning to patient services, they also participate, as do the Physicians, in local practice building activities. These activities include participation in the Referring MD programs designed to create referrals from other physician practices and managing and maintaining long-term relations with their own patient base in order to retain existing patients and create referrals from friends and family members of existing patients. All of these activities benefit the clinic practice generally and their own practices in particular.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>With the benefits of creating and managing a semi-independent practice also come the responsibilities inherent in any mutually supportive team effort.</p><br/>
<p></p>

<p>At the direction of the Physician, assist the Physician in treating all patients, and at the direction of the Physician, maintain a separate schedule specifically for the treatment of Medium and Small Vein Disease.
