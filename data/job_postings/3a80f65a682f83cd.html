<div><div>Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities â€” we're just getting started.
</div></div><div>Facebook Reality Labs is dedicated to the research and development required to bring virtual and augmented reality to billions of people around the world. We have a neural data and signal processing internship available, working with our multidisciplinary Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) team at Facebook's Menlo Park office, where we are developing novel wearable neural interface technologies. Our internship is twelve (12) to twenty-four (24) weeks long and we have various start dates throughout the year.</div><div><div>
