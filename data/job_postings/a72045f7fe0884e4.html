Using and understanding natural language is at the core of Google's technologies. Linguists at Google guide, build, and innovate methodologies around discourse and pragmatics, semantic analysis and representation, syntactic and morphological parsing, lexicon development, speech recognition and synthesis, text classification, ontology development, and human computation. Current areas of focus include dialogue systems, NLU, personalization, product evaluation, and data collection.</p>
<p>You'll collaborate with Researchers, Data Scientists, and Engineers to produce analyses and high quality data that improve our ability to understand and generate natural language in a variety of contexts. Many linguists focus on one or more languages in which they have special expertise, and propose directions and solutions to language-specific problems.</p>
<p>At Google, we hire both Computational Linguists and Analytical Linguists.</p>
<ul><li>A Computational Linguist is expected to have both knowledge of linguistic phenomena and of the technology that is required to model them. As a Computational Linguist Intern, you will collaborate with researchers and engineers in NLU/Machine Intelligence to produce linguistic models and analysis, create high quality data, and develop applications that improve our ability to understand and generate natural language</li><li>As an Analytical Linguist Intern, you will work on specific problems that may span multiple linguistic products across multiple languages. Analytical Linguists work in many different areas of NLP and arrive with a wide variety of skills—your specialization might involve natural language processing, natural language understanding, phonology, phonetics, syntax, semantics, ontology, program management, human subject research, experimental design, statistics, corpus linguistics</li></ul></div><div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Responsibilities</b></h2><ul>
<li>Design resources and processes to support a variety of projects related to natural language understanding</li><li>Work closely with researchers and engineers by providing linguistic expertise and direction for language specific NLP, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Text to Speech (TTS) projects and/or dialogue analysis/modelling</li><li>Propose and run research experiments around linguistic phenomena</li><li>Monitor data acquisition and curation; design quality control methodology, experiments, implementation and improvements</li></ul></div>At Google, we don’t just accept difference—we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community.
