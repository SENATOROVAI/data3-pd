<body><h2>Biostatistician - Los Angeles, CA</h2>
<div><b>Responsibilities</b><p></p><p>
The newly formed Cancer Data Sciences group at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine and UCLA Jonsson Cancer Centre is seeking a Biostatistician with broad biomedical experience. The successful candidate will be working with a broad team of Data Scientists, applying and developing new quantitative strategies to improve our understanding and ability to treat cancer. Statisticians in our team are passionate about applying their knowledge of empirical and theoretical experimental design, data collection, reporting, descriptive analysis, predictive modeling and data visualization. They will implement these analyses in high-quality software, shared broadly with the team as a whole, and often made open-source and publicly avaliable. They execute them on both local high-performance computer infrastructure and a growing set of cloud-based assets. Our datasets comprise hundreds of terrabytes, and are growing rapidly, creating fascinating problems in experimental design, parallelization, multiple hypothesis-testing, multivariable adjustments, optimization, data visualization and reporting. This requires a strong background in statistics or biostatistics, providing a platform for technical leadership, but linked to strong personal communication skills and basic biological or cancer understanding, to help ensure insights are broadly adopted. The successful candidate will be helping us perform research that will transform the lives of cancer patients.<br/>
<br/>
Your responsibilities will be broad, and include an emphasis on experimental design and analysis. You will take a leadership role on a number of projects, both in developing novel methodology and applying existing ones to new datasets and datatypes. On a broad range of studies, you will serve as a source of statistical expertise for a broader team of software engineers and data scientists. You will help drive professional-level statistical practices throughout the entire team, and serve as a local point of expertise for experimental design and statistical practices. You will typically have one or two major and several minor projects at any point in time, making appropriate prioritization, time-management and reporting across these key. We are in a rapid growth-phase, and the successful candidate will be involved in hiring, recruiting and mentoring junior data scientists and programmers.<br/>
