Interns will utilize statistics and computer science to solve complex problems in healthcare. Problem areas include: diagnostic analytics such as image analysis, signal processing and pattern recognition, NLP, scheduling, risk analysis and prevention, outcome analysis, targeting and socio-economic behaviors, personalization - including sentiment, interests and affinities modeling, and process improvement (e.g. making sure patients are referred to the care teams they need). The Intern will interact with vast amounts of clinical and non-clinical data (external data sources, digital, etc.). Interns will learn the data science lifecycle including data acquisition, transformation, data engineering, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, algorithm development, and algorithm deployment into a relevant clinical and/or business context.
