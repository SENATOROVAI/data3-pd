About Bombora
-------------

Bombora provides a global business to business (B2B) intent platform powered by the world's largest publisher data co-op. Our data allows sales and marketing teams to base their actions on the knowledge of which companies are in-market for their products, and empowers marketing teams to practice #SustainableMarketing.

The source of this data is a co-operative of premium B2B media companies whose members contribute anonymized and consent-based content-consumption and behavioral data about their audiences. In turn, they can better understand those audiences, serve advertisers, and monetize their inventory.

We process billions of content interactions daily to detect intent signals from companies around the world. To do this, we use modern distributed processing and machine learning technologies, including Spark, Dataflow/Beam, Airflow, PyTorch, and BigQuery.
