About Instabase

Founded in 2015, Instabase's mission is to advance the state of the art by building tools that help people solve important problems, make discoveries, and create new breakthroughs.

Instabase is an operating system designed for operational efficiency. It uses the web browser as the user interface, a pluggable storage system for managing data (files and databases), and an app store for applications. These applications run on the Instabase Platform, which provides the core management capabilities for managing diverse, distributed datasets; support for collaboration and access control; and a runtime for Instabase Applications.

The applications include state of the art tools for [1] processing a diverse set of unstructured data (scanned images, PDFs, word/excel documents, emails, websites, etc.), [2] running extensible functions with a server-less framework, [3] machine learning (natural language processing, image processing, classification, clustering, etc.), and [4] data science.

Our customers include large enterprises with huge operational costs in a variety of domains, such as financial services (e.g. banks, insurance), healthcare, logistics/supply chain.

As a non-profit initiative, Instabase provides a hosted IPython-style notebook for education, which is widely used by universities (Stanford, MIT, Columbia, University of Chicago, etc.), for teaching classes.

Job Description

As a software engineer focused on natural language processing, you will be designing and building systems that transform text into automated decisions for some of the largest companies in the world. Our platform processes everything from structured text (e.g., forms) to open-domain text (emails) to domain-constrained text (legal documents). As such, you will have to creatively apply a variety of methods depending on the nature of the problem.

You'll work in our Machine Intelligence team, a close-knit group of scientists and engineers who incubate new capabilities from whiteboard sketches all the way to finished apps on the Instabase platform. We take a product-centric approach to research & development, working closely with our customers to identify opportunities and putting as much care into product design as raw capability.

High Value Focus Areas

One or more of the following focus areas are particularly valuable for a candidate to have:


<li>SpaCy: experience building and extending image processing pipelines with SpaCy</li><li>Deep Learning: experience designing neural networks for common NLP tasks such as embedding and text labeling, etc</li>
Requirements


<li>Proven experience working on natural language processing</li><li>Excellent familiarity with the "classic" tasks of NLP, such that you can easily extend and apply them as tools on which to build</li><li>Deep knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and math</li><li>Good dataset creation and maintenance hygiene</li><li>Ability to write robust code in Python</li><li>Excellent teamwork and communication skills</li>
