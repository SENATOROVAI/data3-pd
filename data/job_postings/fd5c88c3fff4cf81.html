<body><h2>Software Product Manager, Framework and Applications - Deep Learning - Santa Clara, CA 95050</h2>
<p>Deep Learning is an exciting new area of machine learning. To bring AI to life, neural networks need to be trained and deployed with domain specific knowledge. Training and inference can be integrated into applications in the data center or at the edge, such as in automobiles, drones, medical devices, and more. Some of the common applications using NVIDIA deep learning software are image classification, object detection, recommendations, conversational virtual assistants, and reinforcement learning.
</p><p></p><p>As a Deep Learning Applications Product Manager you will be working closely with our external customers across all business verticals as well as major cloud providers and internal customers, such as the NVIDIA Drive, Robotics, Research, and Jetson platform customers. You will need to understand the popular applications for deep learning (e.g. Computer Vision, Speech and Audio, Natural Language Processing and Recommendation Engines), the neural networks for those applications and how they can be optimized and deployed to target GPU accelerators.
</p><p></p><p>As Product Manager, you will lead key pieces of NVIDIA's portfolio of software and platforms that are enabling breakthroughs in artificial intelligence through scientific computing and deep learning. You will engage with customers, define products and roadmaps, develop business strategy, devise marketing positioning, and take your products to market. You will have the ability to adapt strategies to changing business environments, along with a strong background in software for technical computing and programming SDKs.
</p><p>The Product Management organization is a small, strong, and visible group both inside and outside of NVIDIA as our team is focused on deep learning use cases to drive the company's strategy. We need a self-starter to continue to grow this area and work with customers who are on the cutting edge of AI.
