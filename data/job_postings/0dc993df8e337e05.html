The Advanced Technology Center (ATC) is the research lab for Lockheed Martin Space. Through our own skills and those of our partners—including universities and research labs around the world—we are able to put vision in motion. While we are a part of LM's space division, our technologies are far-reaching across domains. Napkin sketches of lasers that can shoot down UAVs—we made it real. Changing molecules so metals behave differently? We invented that. ATC’s story is written in the success of missions here on Earth and far, far into space. Our innovation extends beyond incremental change. We strive for first-of-a-kind capability with enduring impact. Whatever the application, our charter is to create game-changing technologies. At the ATC, we are inspiring change in our endless pursuit of what is next.<br/>
