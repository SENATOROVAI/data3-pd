<body><h2>Data Analyst - San Francisco, CA</h2>
<p>Love live music? Want to be part of one of the few tech startups currently making a real impact on the music industry?</p>
<p>At Lyte, we help fans get into their favorite events, with a ticketing experience that doesn't suck - no scalpers or fake tickets.</p>
<p>Want to watch the software you build immediately get put to use at the highest levels of the music industry? If there is popular music event or festival that is sold out, we are most probably close partners, think the biggest names in the industry! To name a few, Coachella, Burning Man, ComicCon, Electric Forest, Newport Folk Festival, AfroPunk, and BottleRock. Don't see your favorite event or artist here yet? Help make it a reality.</p>
<p>Want to join a team of hard working, fun loving people who are still a little weird and know how to both ship rock solid code and not take life too seriously? The Lyte engineering team is scrappy crew of technology professionals who have experience across the early stage startup realm.</p>
<p>In addition to being technically savvy, we love music and events and when we are not pushing code, we are actively trying to have fun in life. Some of our team members are in bands, and some just like to play flute by themselves out in the mountains.</p><p>
