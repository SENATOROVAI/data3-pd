<body><h2>Data Scientist - Portland, OR</h2>
THE CHALLENGE

Every company has strategic priorities and urgency to achieve them, but very few have a cohesive, data driven approach to aligning, measuring and driving those strategic priorities at market speed. Yet, this is perhaps the most important business process to growth, and it's the least automated today.

At WorkBoard, we're creating an entirely new solution category with our Strategy & Results Platform to engage everyone from the CEO to the receptionist in understanding, aligning and achieving their organization's strategy faster. We're solving a real pain for customers, and our business is tripling every year! As a Data Scientist you will literally have your pulse on the data that partly makes WorkBoard so successful. You will have to think deeply, carefully and strategically. Remain agile, open and focused on execution. You will be an integral element in our continued growth and part of a team that shares in its success as a whole.

THE OPPORTUNITY

As a foundational member of our Data Science team, you'll work closely with our Director of Engineering, AI and Data Science to develop, extend and refine our data processes, insights and visualizations. You'll provide ideas, proof of concepts, develop and deploy production models/solutions along with guidance on infrastructure support and scale.

THE TEAM

You'll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve the quality of experience we provide our customers by delivering at our best and being voracious learners. We are an incredibly supportive team and close to our customers. When problems arise, everyone in the engineering team pitches in. We are excited about a lot of things—what "best" looks like for our customers, what "breakthrough" looks like in engineering—and we share these passions across the company and with our customers. Customers even attend our hackathons, affectionately named WoBoCon.

COMING IN

Bring 2-4 years of experience in Data Science, an analyzer mindset, and a technical degree. You'll be supporting our product, sales, leadership, and marketing teams with insights gained from analyzing company data.
